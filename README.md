# Simple Jogging Spots in Singapore App

Created an app for my Java Module

Do note no database included.

This application keeps track of Joggin Spots.

I used MariaDB for database (Not Included)

Implements CRUD using SQL Query by JDBC Driver.

Incorporates regular expression, polymorphism, OOP and other programming concepts in Java.

Thank you.
