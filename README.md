# Simple Jogging Spots in Singapore App

Created an app for my Java Module

Do note no database included.

This application keeps track of Joggin Spots.

I used MariaDB for database (Not Included)

Implements CRUD using SQL Query by JDBC Driver and JavaFX for GUI and navigation.

Incorporates regular expression, polymorphism, OOP and other programming concepts in Java.

Thank you.
